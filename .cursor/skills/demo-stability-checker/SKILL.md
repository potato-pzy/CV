# Demo Stability Checker

## Instructions

1. **Flag only demo-breaking issues**:
   - Layout collapse or overflow at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
   - Content cut off or unreadable
   - Broken interactions or missing fallbacks

2. **Ignore**:
   - Cosmetic tweaks (minor alignment, spacing)
   - Subjective improvements
   - Edge cases unlikely in demo flow

3. **Priority**: Visual stability > perfection.
